ERROR
 --> Programmer mistake (we did something wrong).
 --> Calling a function with invalid arguments, index out of bounds etc.
 --> Program should terminate immediately (not safe to recover).

EXCEPTION
--> Failure condition: something unexcepted happened.
--> Unexcepted: out of our control.
--> Handle it (e.g. show message to user) and recover.
